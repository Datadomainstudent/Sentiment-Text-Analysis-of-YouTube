# Sentiment-Text-Analysis-of-YouTube

Description:
This project focuses on conducting sentiment analysis on user comments extracted from YouTube videos. The aim is to gauge the sentiment of the audience towards the content using Python programming language and various data analysis libraries.

Project Components:

Data Collection: The dataset used for this analysis consists of user comments extracted from YouTube videos. Data was obtained using the YouTube API or web scraping techniques.

Data Preprocessing: Before analysis, the data underwent preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, text cleaning, and tokenization to prepare it for sentiment analysis.

Sentiment Analysis: Sentiment analysis was performed using the TextBlob library to extract polarity and subjectivity metrics from the comments. Polarity indicates the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of the comment, while subjectivity measures the extent to which the comment expresses opinions versus factual information.

Data Visualization: Visualizations such as word clouds and bar charts were generated to represent the distribution of positive and negative sentiments within the comments. Additionally, common emojis were identified and visualized to gain insights into audience engagement and interaction patterns.
